                <h5>Analysis of the Enagement Report</h5>
                <p>In the Engagement Report, the average engagement time was 1 min and 33 sec. The average engagement
                    time per session was 44 sec. The average engagement time was relatively short. The number of event
                    counts was 303, which seems to be a lot. However, I have four pages, and the number of events was
                    the sum of all events on these four pages, so on average, the number of events per page per session
                    was not a lot. One-third of the event count was page_view. It is good because I want the viewer to
                    see my profile and read through my project descriptions. I also embedded several project links, and
                    I want viewers to click these links to check my projects. But according to the report, only a few
                    viewers clicked on the project link. When I first posted this link on the canvas, my classmates view
                    on my website very often for the first week. After one or two weeks, no one wants to view my website
                    again, so the number of events decreases dramatically. To increase the interaction between viewers
                    and my websites, I can add some interesting website projects I created to get attention from
                    viewers. In this way, viewers will know more about my coding skills and my passion for website
                    development.</p>
