        <p>CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another.
            Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that
            indicate the start and end states of the animationâ€™s style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.</p>
        <p>To create a CSS animation sequence, you style the element you want to animate with the animation property or
            its sub-properties. This lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation
            sequence should progress</p>
